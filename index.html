      <h3>
        Hello,
        <br>Iâ€™m Caitlyn Clabaugh.
      </h3>
      <h4>
        I'm a senior Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science, graduating from the <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering</a> this fall 2018.

        My passion is human-centered Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to enable robots and autonomous agents to better interact with, learn from, and socially assist humans in the real world.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Co-advised by professors <a href="http://www-robotics.usc.edu/~maja/">Maja Matari&cacute;</a> and <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/">Fei Sha</a>, I am dually trained in the fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as well as Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Machine Interaction.
        Specifically, my research applies advanced computational methods for interactive personalization and long-term adaptation of socially assistive agents to human users.   
        <br><br>
        I am deeply connected to issues surrounding neurodiversity and disability rights, so much of my work focuses on applications to differentiated education and personalized health care.
        I've been honored by the 2018 <a href="https://viterbigrad.usc.edu/news-and-events/graduate-awards/viterbi-undergraduate-research-mentoring-award/">Viterbi Undergraduate Research Mentoring Award</a> and <a href="https://websites.usc.edu/StudentRecognition/Home/TheAwards">The Order of Aret&eacute;</a> at USC for my mentoring and K-12 STEM outreach activities.

          In-home Socially Assistive Robot for <br>
          Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
        </h4>
        <img src="images/sarasd.jpeg" alt="Socially Assistive Robot for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder"/>
        <p>Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) has potential to supplement expensive and often inaccessible therapy for children affected with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). As part of this multi-university NSF Expedition in Computing, we are deploying SAR systems in the family homes of children with ASD for 30 day interventions. The intervention focuses on sequencing and ordering, turn taking, and emotion recognition skills, adapting its instruction to each individual child over time and socially engaging them in learning through play.</p>

          Socially Assistive Robot for Tutoring <br>
          Mathematics in a Preschool Classroom
        </h4>
        <img src="images/sartutor.jpg" alt="Socially Assistive Robot Tutor for Preschool Mathematics"/>
        <p>In this research, we developed a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) tutoring system to support the efforts of educators in teaching number concepts to preschool children. The SAR system was iteratively designed with the input of education experts to be developmentally appropriate. The  system was deployed in a real-world preschool classroom. The data collected were used to train personalized models of number concepts learning, leveraging the multimodal data, domain knowledge, and learning style.</p>
